# # Post-processing DayCent corn stover regional simulation results
# This Jupyter Notebook is designed to facilitate post-processing and analysis of sets of raw DayCent results from a regional scale simulation. For more information, contact author [John Field](https://johnlfield.weebly.com/) at <john.L.field@gmail.com>
#
# ## DayCent background
# DayCent is a process-based model that simulates agro-ecosystem net primary production, soil organic matter dynamics, and nitrogen (N) cycling and trace gas emissions. DayCent is a daily-timestep version of the older CENTURY model. Both models were created and are currently maintained at the Colorado State University [Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory](https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/) (CSU-NREL), and source code is available upon request.

# DayCent model homepage:  [https://www2.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/daycent/](https://www2.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/daycent/)
#
# In bioenergy sustainability studies, DayCent is typically used to estimate:
# * biomass yields
# * annual emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) generated in soils from synthetic and organic nitrogen fertilizer
# * changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) levels over time
#
# ## Regional simulation workflow
# The primary spatial data inputs to DayCent are:
# * soil texture as a function of depth
# * historic daily weather (Tmin, Tmax, precip)
#
# Our DayCent spatial modeling workflow is based on a national-scale GIS database of current land use ([NLCD](https://www.mrlc.gov/national-land-cover-database-nlcd-2016)), soil ([SSURGO](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/?cid=nrcs142p2_053627)), and weather ([NARR](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/north-american-regional-reanalysis-narr)) data layers housed at CSU-NREL. The python-based workflow consists of a collection of scripts that perform the following:
# 1. Selection of area to be simulated, specified based on current land cover and/or land biophysical factors (i.e., soil texutre, slope, land capability class rating, etc.)
# 2. Determination of individual unique DayCent model runs (i.e., **"strata"**) necessary to cover the heterogenity of soils and climate across the simulation area
# 3. Parallel execution of simulations on the CSU-NREL computing cluster
# 4. Results analysis and mapping (this routine)

# ## Loading data
# The code below loads partially-analyzed DayCent simulation results at the county scale into Pandas dataframes for furhter analysis. Results are included for four different management scenarios that were simulated:
# * no stover removal (G, i.e., grain harvest only)
# * 25% stover harvest (G25S)
# * 50% stover harvest (G50S)
# * 75% stover harvest (G75S)
#
# Simulation results are spread across multiple .csv-format results files as follows:
# * cornâ€“soy area per county (area_fips_data.csv)
# * annual simulated corn yields per county (corn_yield_year_county.csv)
# * annual simulated soy yields per county (soybean_yield_year_county.csv)
# * annual simulated stover yields per county (Stover_yield_year_county.csv)
# * annual simulated SOC levels per county (SOC_year_county.csv)
# * annual simulated N2O emissions per county (N2O_year_county.csv)

# ## Computing annual SOC differences
# I implemented this by ordering the data by fips|treatment|time, computing row differences, and then dropping the first year of each series (which reflects a difference between treatments instead of between years).

# ## Data aggregation & merges
# Here I calculate mean yields, N2O emissions & SOC changes over the full course of the simulation, and then merge all results together into a single data frame. Note that the aggregation has to come before the merges, since corn & soy are harvested in alternate years and thus cannot be merged on 'simyear'. Also, note that all year 2011 yield results are dropped on merge, since there are no dSOC results for that year.

# * compute net CO2e biogenic GHG footprint

# ## Mapping our results
# Below we use the Plotly module "choropleth" tool to map select county-scale results. The fips_mapping() function helps to standardize the formatting, color scheme, and scale for each map.
